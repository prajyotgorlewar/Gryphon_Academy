Intro:
Hi, I'm Prajyot Gorlewar, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at RCOEM, Nagpur. I’ve worked on impactful Android projects like CampusNav, a GPS-free multi-floor campus navigation app with student-faculty communication, and a video chat app with calling features. Outside academics, I’m passionate about game development, where I enjoy combining creativity with logic to build engaging experiences.
