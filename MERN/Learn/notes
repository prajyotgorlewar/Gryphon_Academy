Functions are first class citizens in JS.
they are considered as objects.
they can be passed as arguments to other functions.

There are hoisted and non hoisted function: hoisted function can be called before it is declared.
A non hoisted function is assigned like a variable
in non hoisting as a function bvlaue is assigned to a variabl its contact changes


when you use a named function within an object the named variable are in context of the object, therefore it is not recommmended to use arrow functions.
