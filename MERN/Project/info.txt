DataBase:

1. IP : where the db is running
2. port : Mongodb 27017

sql vs nosql:
1. Sql databases like mysql and oracle they have strict constraints like foreign key and primary key they work best in systems like library management sysms, employee managements systems and even in commerce management systems.
2. In case of no sql there i sno schema and no contrainsts example mongodb and mongodb atlas.
3. however to connect a mern stack applicaion to mongodb we need an extra layer of mongoose.

Traditionallly we create a dataase and the the table then insert records. --DD firt approach
As for now we just create the database and tale are created programatically using ORMs
We also nedd migration tools

Real life Analogy:
RDBMS(SQL)          MongoDB(NoSql)
database            database
table               collection
row                 document
column              field


Every document that you insert has a specific id called object Id

Q. Create a collection department with id and department name insert 4 records display all the records and find a record where department name is sales.

We don not delete the records but we do a soft delete where a boolean variable isActive is set to false.
